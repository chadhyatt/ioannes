/*
	From our dear friend Tim:
	> The F in the Unreal Engine naming convention originated in FVector, where it
	> stood for "floating point vector". U for Unreal's managed objects, T for templated
	> containers, A for actor subclasses, and F stuck for simple structs.

	Subsequently, all (generic) T-types are in templates, F-types in structs, U-types
	in objects, and so-on.
